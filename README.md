### Running Kuru Anime's Discord Bot yourself

Before you start working on the bot we need to first install some prerequisites.

- An editor of your choice or you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)

It's also worth mentioning that if you don't know that much about JavaScript then you will have a hard time working on the bot. You still can work on the bot but you'll probably have some problems here and there. If you want to know more, here are a few links that [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/) compiled:

- [CodeCademy's interactive JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
- [Eloquent JavaScript, a free online book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [Nodeschool, for both JavaScript and Node.js lessons](https://nodeschool.io/)
- [MDN's JavaScript guide and full documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Google, your best friend](https://google.com/)

### Checking if they are installed

Test if the prerequisites are installed properly by checking their current versions in your system.

For Yarn:
```
yarn --version
```

For Node.js:
```
node --version
```

For Git
```
git --version
```

They should, in theory, return their versions if they are properly installed.

### Setting up your own application

Once they are all installed we can then proceed to setting up our own server and bot for testing.

It easy! So don't worry.

1. Open up the Discord website and login.
2. Hover over the "Developers" drop-down menu and click on the Developer Portal link.
3. Click on the "New Application" button.
4. Enter a name and optionally select a team (if you want the bot to belong to one). Then confirm the pop-up window by clicking the "Create" button.
