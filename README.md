### Running Kuru Anime's Discord Bot yourself

Before you start working on the bot we need to first install some prerequisites.

- An editor of your choice or you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

It's also worth mentioning that if you don't know that much about JavaScript then you will have a hard time working on the bot. You still can work on the bot but you'll probably have some problems here and there. If you want to know more, here are a few links that [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/) compiled:
